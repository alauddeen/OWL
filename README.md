# Optimized Warehouse Logistics

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an autonomous bot designed for optimizing warehouse logistics. Utilizing a combination of real-time image processing and robotics, the bot is capable of navigating through environments, identifying markers for precise pick-up and drop-off tasks. This system aims to enhance efficiency in warehousing and inventory management by automating routine tasks.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Marker Detection**: Leverages computer vision techniques to detect and interpret markers, guiding the botâ€™s movement.
- **Automated Navigation**: Employs intelligent algorithms to enable the bot to navigate autonomously within its environment.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Utilizes MG995 servo motors for movement, controlled by a NodeMCU board.

## Current State
The project is in an active development phase. It successfully demonstrates basic functionalities of autonomous navigation and marker detection. However, it still requires further streamlining and optimization for more efficient operation in real-world warehouse scenarios.

### Incomplete and Future Work
Some functionalities are still under development and have not been included in this repository. Planned enhancements include:
- Improved error handling and robustness.
- Advanced pathfinding algorithms for optimal route selection.
- Integration with IoT devices for enhanced operational capabilities.
- Improving proper command generation and solve issues of lag


*Note: This project is a work-in-progress and is part of an ongoing academic effort in the field of robotics and automation.*
